		Sathorn Model is a project that has attempted to find a sustainable 
		solution for traffic congestion problems in the Sathorn'area, Bangkok. 
		The activities are managed by the Faculty of Engineering, Chulalongkorn 
		University. Sathorn Road serves as the gateway linking the residential 
		area on the western side of the Chao Phraya River and the river-eastern 
		side’s business area. The number of 150,000 vehicles drive every
		weekday on Sathorn Road. The Sathorn-Surasak intersection has both 
		inbound and outbound traffic flow. There are a total of three types 
		of sensors installed on the approaching lanes of the Sathorn-Surasak 
		intersection in the Sathorn area: CCTV cameras, thermal cameras and 
		induction loop coil sensors. Traffic volume data are collected every 5 s 
		from CCTV sensors for 37 months from September 2016 to September 2019. 
		Traffic volume and occupancy are collected every 5 s from loop coil 
		sensors for 5 months from May 2016 to September 2016. The dataset has 
		temporal and spatial coverage of Sathorn road's main urban areas, 
		including weekdays, weekends, and public and national holidays.
